description: Update team member information and profile photo in the Jekyll academic website

## What I do

Update team member information in `_data/team.csv` and manage profile photos in the `assets/images/team/` directory. This includes updating metadata (name, affiliation, title, URL) and replacing or downloading new profile photos.

## Team data file

Location: `_data/team.csv`

CSV format with columns:
- `username` - Unique identifier (kebab-case, used in publications)
- `name` - Full name with proper diacritics
- `affiliation` - Institution/organization
- `title` - Academic or professional title
- `url` - Personal website or profile URL
- `image` - Path to profile photo (local or external URL)

## Profile photo requirements

### Image specifications
- **Size**: 320x320 pixels (square)
- **Format**: JPEG (.jpg)
- **Location**: `assets/images/team/[username].jpg`
- **Aspect ratio**: 1:1 (must not stretch)

### Image processing workflow

1. **Download from external URL** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   curl -s "[URL]" -o assets/images/team/[username]-temp.jpg
   ```

2. **Check original dimensions**:
   ```bash
   sips -g pixelWidth -g pixelHeight assets/images/team/[username]-temp.jpg
   ```

3. **If not square, crop first** (preserve aspect ratio):
   - For portrait photos (height > width): Crop to square keeping face centered
   - For landscape photos (width > height): Crop to square
   - Use image editing tools or ask user to crop manually
   - Save original for user to crop: `assets/images/team/[username].jpg`

4. **If already square or after cropping, resize**:
   ```bash
   sips -z 320 320 assets/images/team/[username].jpg
   ```

5. **Verify final dimensions**:
   ```bash
   file assets/images/team/[username].jpg
   # Should show: JPEG image data ... 320x320
   ```

### Image path conventions

**Prefer local paths**:
- Local: `/assets/images/team/[username].jpg` (recommended)
- External: Full HTTPS URL (avoid - links break over time)

**Migration from external to local**:
When replacing broken external URLs (Google Sites, etc.), always download and save locally.

## Common tasks

### Update basic information

Edit `_data/team.csv` to update:
- Name (ensure proper diacritics)
- Affiliation
- Title (e.g., "Professor", "Associate Professor", "PhD Candidate")
- URL

### Replace broken photo URL

1. Identify broken external URL (Google Sites, university sites, etc.)
2. Download photo from source or user's website
3. Save original to `assets/images/team/[username].jpg`
4. Let user crop if needed (don't stretch)
5. Resize to 320x320
6. Update CSV with local path: `/assets/images/team/[username].jpg`

### Add new team member

1. Choose username (kebab-case, usually lastname)
2. Add row to `team.csv` with all fields
3. Download and process photo following workflow above
4. Verify photo is 320x320 and not stretched

## Example workflow

```bash
# Download photo
curl -s "https://example.com/photo.jpg" -o assets/images/team/smith.jpg

# Check if square
sips -g pixelWidth -g pixelHeight assets/images/team/smith.jpg

# If not square, user crops manually, then resize
sips -z 320 320 assets/images/team/smith.jpg

# Verify
file assets/images/team/smith.jpg
```

Update CSV:
```csv
smith,John Smith,University Name,Assistant Professor,https://johnsmith.com,/assets/images/team/smith.jpg
```

## Important notes

- **Never stretch images** - Always maintain aspect ratio
- **Crop before resize** - If image is not square, crop first
- **User review** - Let user verify cropped photos before resizing
- **Local storage preferred** - External URLs break over time
- **Proper diacritics** - Ensure names use correct special characters
- **Consistent titles** - Use standard academic titles

## Verification checklist

- [ ] Photo is 320x320 pixels
- [ ] Photo is not stretched (1:1 aspect ratio)
- [ ] Photo uses local path in CSV
- [ ] All CSV fields are filled correctly
- [ ] Name has proper diacritics
- [ ] Title is appropriate and consistent
- [ ] Changes committed to git
