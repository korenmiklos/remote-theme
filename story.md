- copy: I always wanted to be both an economist and a programmer. I love how computers can solve all kinds of problems through systematic thinking. Learning software engineering practices has transformed how I do research. Having clear structures in place actually gives me more freedom to explore new ideas.

    I apply these methods in my research and teaching at CEU, helping students combine economic thinking with coding skills. As Data Editor of the Review of Economic Studies, I work with economists to make their research reproducible. Through this website and my software tools in Stata, Python and Julia, I share practical approaches to better research.
