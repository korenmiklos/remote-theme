description: "How did Hungarian top managers differ in the 1980s and the 1990s? We study manager and entrepreneur biographies, focusing on the role of foreign experience while studying or learning. Early foreign experience, acquired during socialism, is not correlated with firm performance. By contrast, foreign experience acquired after the transition to capitalism is associated with higher firm performance. "
