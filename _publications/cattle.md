description: 'We introduce location choice in a multi-sector general equilibrium model
  to study how it affects development accounting. Producers in agriculture, manufacturing
  and services choose their location to trade off land rents with transport costs
  to the city center. We show how space affects the aggregate production Function
  and decompose output per worker into productivity, land per worker, and a term adjusting
  for sector location. In our model, services are luxury goods. As a result, richer
  cities have larger service cores, higher service prices, and relatively less output
  per worker in services. These predictions are broadly consistent with the data.
  We calibrate our model to data on cities in OECD countries and show that land and
  location explain 10--30 percentage points of the variation in output per worker.
