description: "We survey the recent economics literature on international trade and global production. We identify five areas where further research would help policy makers: gains from global production sharing, more quantitative analysis of the redistribution effects of globalization, a better understanding of cross-border frictions, and estimates of the side effect of trade. With the goal of providing a research agenda, we identify nineteen specific challenges for measurement, theory, and policy analysis.\n"

We survey the recent economics literature on international trade and global production. We identify five areas where further research would help policy makers: gains from global production sharing, more quantitative analysis of the redistribution effects of globalization, a better understanding of cross-border frictions, and estimates of the side effect of trade. With the goal of providing a research agenda, we identify nineteen specific challenges for measurement, theory, and policy analysis.
