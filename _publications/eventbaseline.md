description: eventbaseline is a Stata package that transforms the coefficients estimated
  by xthdidregress into a correct event study relative to a baseline. The reported
  coefficients are the average treatment effects on the treated (ATT) for each period
  relative to the baseline. The baseline can be either a period before the treatment
  or the average of the pre-treatment periods
