description: "Generative AI is directional: it performs well in some task directions and poorly in others. We develop a high-dimensional model of AI adoption in which both the worker and the tool have convex production possibility sets, and adoption is a team-production decision. The key sufficient statistics are the worker's pre-AI shadow (autarky) prices; a tool is adopted when its direction is valuable at these prices. As capability improves, adopted directions expand in a cone around autarky prices, with threshold and intensive-margin structure."

Generative AI is directional: it performs well in some task directions and poorly in others. We develop a high-dimensional model of AI adoption in which both the worker and the tool have convex production possibility sets, and adoption is a team-production decision.

As capability improves, adopted directions expand in a cone around autarky prices, with threshold and intensive-margin structure.
