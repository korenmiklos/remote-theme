description: "Using detailed U.S. and Spanish export data, we document that trade costs of a per-shipment nature are associated with less frequent and larger shipments, i.e. more lumpiness, in international trade. This finding is pervasive across broad product categories, but most apparent for food products, industrial supplies and parts and accessories.\n"

Using detailed U.S. and Spanish export data, we document that trade costs of a per-shipment nature are associated with less frequent and larger shipments, i.e. more lumpiness, in international trade. This finding is pervasive across broad product categories, but most apparent for food products, industrial supplies and parts and accessories.
