description: "We estimate the effect of expatriate CEOs on firm performance using Hungarian administrative data. Comparing firms with expatriate and local CEOs following a foreign acquisition, we find that expatriates increase TFP by 8.5% and sales by 118%. Interpreting these effects through the lens of an industry equilibrium model reveals that 87% of revenue gains stem from TFP improvements, with capital deepening and export market access contributing 10% and 3%. The decomposition is similar across sectors, except export gains are absent in nontradable sectors. Our results suggest that expatriates create value primarily through superior general management skills."
