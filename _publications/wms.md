description: This paper describes the 2018 wave of the World Management Survey in
  Hungary. We compare the management practices of firms run by managers who started
  their careers before the transition from socialism to capitalism. We find that older
  managers are less likely to use modern management practices, such as performance
  monitoring, target setting, and incentives.
