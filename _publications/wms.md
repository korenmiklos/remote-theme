description: "This paper describes the 2018 wave of the World Management Survey in Hungary. We compare the management practices of firms run by managers who started their careers before the transition from socialism to capitalism. We find that older managers are less likely to use modern management practices, such as performance monitoring, target setting, and incentives."

This paper describes the 2018 wave of the World Management Survey in Hungary. We compare the management practices of firms run by managers who started their careers before the transition from socialism to capitalism. We find that older managers are less likely to use modern management practices, such as performance monitoring, target setting, and incentives.
