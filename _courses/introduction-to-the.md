description: This lesson will introduce learners to fundamental skills needed for
  working with their computers through a command-line interface (using the bash shell).
  They will learn how to navigate their file system, computationally manipulate their
  files (e.g. copying, moving, renaming), search files, redirect output and write
  shell scripts. By the end of the lesson, learners will be prepared to move on to
  using more advanced command line tools.
