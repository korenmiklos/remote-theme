description: Management practices differ widely across countries. Here we show that
  they also vary over time. Using the World Management Survey for Hungary, we document
  that younger managers adopt better management practices. We hypothesize that such
  cohort effects are specific to transition economies, with some of the manager skills
  becoming obsolete after a post-communist transition.
