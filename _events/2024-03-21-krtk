title: Communist Era Managers in Modern Times: A Comparison of Management Skills Across Generations
description: Management practices differ widely across countries. Here we show that they also vary over time. 
Using the World Management Survey for Hungary, we document that younger managers adopt better management practices. 
We hypothesize that such cohort effects are specific to transition economies, with some of the manager skills becoming obsolete after a post-communist transition.
